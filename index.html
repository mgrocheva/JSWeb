                                            Get in touch with us to discuss your requirements. We can talk you through the process and arrange a 
                                            free consultation with our team. During the initial meeting we will listen to your ideas and vision,
                                            and give some initial ideas and suggestions on how to best achieve this within your allocated budget.
                                            Following this meeting we will send you a proposal and fee quotation.

                                           This is a vital part of the process. Before any works can begin on site, 
                                           we will meet with you several times to develop the brief, producing a full
                                           drawing package and specification schedules; culminating in the construction
                                           scope of works, budget and timeline. Any required planning applications and 
                                           notifications will also happen in this period. Once you are happy with the 
                                           proposal and the budget, both parties sign the contract and work on site can
                                           begin.
